## Quick Start Guide
+ Read [Dependency and Compilation](#CompilationGuide) and build the application;
+ Glance at instructions in [Basic Operation](#BasicOperation), rotate faces in whatever way you like until solving it becomes interesting;
+ In case you stuck at some point, invoke hint mode by pressing H; you may want to familiar yourself with [Notations](#Notations) that appear in the hints;
+ Follow the hints and solve the puzzle. Don't worry if you mess up with steps shown in the hints -- the hints will get updated **in real time**.

## <a name="BasicOperation"></a> Basic Operations

#### View Mode: view cube with mouse
+ press down and hold **left button** for roration
+ press down and hold **right button** for translation
+ forward/backward rotate **middle wheel** for zoom in/out
+ press **F** to toggle on/off the face color indicator cube on bottom left corner
+ press **Ctrl+S** to take a screenshot
+ press **Ctrl+Q** to exit

#### Interactive Mode: select and rotate faces
+ **double click** on a face to activate it, then rotate
+ **double click** at any point not on the cube to deactivate face selection and back to view mode
+ when a face is activated, **Ctrl+(left|right|wheel)** mouse buttons enables temporary view mode without exiting the interactive mode

#### Hint Mode: guide to a solution
+ press **H** to toggle hint mode (next move and number of moves left shown on top left)

## <a name="CompilationGuide"></a> Dependency and Compilation

#### Dependency
+ **Qt 5**: Cubik is built upon the Qt framework. You need at least Qt 5.2.1 to compile it. If your default Ubuntu repository does not contain Qt5, check out this [link](http://askubuntu.com/questions/279421/how-can-i-install-qt-5-x-on-12-04-lts).
+ **GLU**: Starting from Qt 4.8, the GLU dependecy has been removed from standard Qt versions. Since the library we use still depends on GLU and GL, you may have to install these OpenGL pacakges if they are not already installed. Generally this can be done by (the second apt-get is necessary only if "-lGL is missing" after attempting to compile Cubik after executing the first apt-get; see [source link](http://qt-project.org/forums/viewthread/23855/#110514))
```
sudo apt-get install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev -y
```
+ **libQGLViewer**: Cubik replies heavily on the library [libQGLViewer](http://www.libqglviewer.com/), which is a C++ library based on Qt that eases the creation of OpenGL 3D viewers. We have already included the header files and compiled libraries (under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS) to Cubik. As long as you have Qt and GLU installed, you should be fine.

#### Compilation
This compilation procedure has been tested on multiple independent machines running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty Tahr).

Follow these steps to copy this repository to your local directory and build:
```
git clone https://github.com/trgao10/Cubik
cd Cubik/
qmake
make
```
After the compilation, you need to specify the path to load shared libarary "libQGLViewer.so":
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
That's all. Happy Cubik-ing!
```
./Cubik
```

## <a name="Notations"></a> Notations for the Algorithm

The solution integrated into this version of Cubik is based on [Mark Jeay's algorithm](http://www.jeays.net/rubiks.htm). This algorithm is classic for beginner-level users since it is solved intuitively layer by layer. However, it is definetely not a fast algorithm which involves more steps than some other solutions.

The notation is adapted from an earlier [Rubik's Cube Contest](http://tomas.rokicki.com/cubecontest/). The 6 faces of the cube are denoted as U (top/yellow), D (bottom/white), F (front/blue), B (back/green), L (left/orange), and R (right/red), respectively. Each solution step provided in the hint mode indicates one of the following two operations on the corresponding face:

1. 90-degree turn clockwise: U, D, F, B, L, R;

2. 90-degree turn counter-clockwise: U', D', F', B', L', R'.

Note that clockwise and counter-clockwise turns are viewed with respect to the center of the face.

The solution algorithm consists of 7 phases in general:

1. solve *up layer edge pieces*;

2. solve *up layer corner pieces*;

3. solve *middle layer*;

4. put *down layer edge pieces* in correct positions;

5. put *down layer edge pieces* in correct directions;

6. put *down layer corner pieces* in correct positions;

7. put *down layer corner pieces* in correct directions.

The hint mode specifies which phase of the algorithm the user is currently at.
